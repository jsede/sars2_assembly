# SARS-CoV-2 de novo assembly

This is a work-in-progress but aims to provide a simple SARS-CoV-2 denovo assembly pipeline using commonly available tools. For now, I provide the script I have been running in my local environment to assemble complete genome libraries made using the following protocol:

SARS2_assemble.sh is the original assembly script.

SARS2_assemble_WGS_v1.1.sh is an updated version that incorporates clipping of WGS primers.
